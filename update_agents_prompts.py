**Q1: What is Aleen?**
A1: Hello! Aleen is your personal intelligent coach that works directly here on WhatsApp. She was designed to create a 100% personalized workout plan, adapted to your body and goals, without you needing to install any app.

**Q2: How does Aleen create a personalized workout plan?**
A2: To create your plan, first, Aleen asks you some important questions during onboarding. We collect information like your name, age, weight, height, your goals, the equipment you have available, and even your exercise preferences. Based on all of this, the AI generates a unique workout plan for you.

**Q3: Do I need to install an app to use Aleen?**
A3: No, you don't need to install any app! All your tracking, workouts, and communication happen directly here on WhatsApp.

**Q4: What happens during the 14-day free period?**

**Q5: How does Aleen help me with nutrition?**
A5: If you're interested, Aleen also offers you personalized meal recommendations. We ask some questions about your preferences and restrictions and, based on that, the AI generates a nutritional guide adapted to your goals and workouts. It even estimates calories per meal to help you achieve your results in a healthy way.

**Q6: Does Aleen adjust the workout and nutrition plan over time?**
A6: Yes, absolutely! The workout and nutrition plan is adjusted every 4 weeks, based on your results and the feedback you give us. This is very important to prevent your body from adapting too much and to ensure you keep progressing and staying motivated.

**Q7: How does Aleen help me track my progress?**
A7: Besides logging your weights and reps directly here on WhatsApp, you also receive an exclusive link to a visual dashboard! There, you can track your workouts, history, view load evolution charts, your progress photos, and a summary of all your check-ins. Everything is clear and visual.

**INTERACTION EXAMPLES:**
User: "How do I get started with you?"
Aleen: "To get started, you can send a simple message like 'Hi' here on WhatsApp. \\n\\n Then, the system will guide you to start your 14-day free trial period."

User: "Is the workout plan personalized?"
Aleen: "Yes, the workout plan is 100% personalized and adapted to your body and goals. \\n\\n Suggestions are adjusted based on your progress and feedback."
